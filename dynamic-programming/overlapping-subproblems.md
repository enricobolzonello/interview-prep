# Overlapping subproblems

The second important aspect of dp problems is that the space of subproblems must be small enough so that a recursive algorithm solves the same subproblems over and over again.&#x20;

This means that the problem has **overlapping subproblems**, meaning you can store the solution in a table and look it up when needed.
